# Multi-attribute-Gaussian-Copula-Graphical-Model

All the algorithms are contained in "SGL.cpp", which is writen with RcppEigen.

In order to use it, you can code 'sourceCpp("SGL.cpp")' in R, but it takes a long time to compile. 
Instead, you can build R package with "SGL.cpp", and you only need to compile once when installing.
